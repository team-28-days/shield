    <h3>What is measles?</h3>
    <p>Measles is a serious respiratory disease that causes a rash and fever. 
        Measles is especially dangerous, and even deadly, for infants, 
        small children, and individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms of measles</h3>
    <p>Measles symptoms typically begin with high fever, cough, runny nose,
         and red, watery eyes. After 3-5 days, a rash usually begins on the face
          and spreads to other parts of the body.</p>
    <h3>How is it spread?</h3> 
    <p>Measles is extremely contagious and spreads when a person
       with measles breathes out, coughs or sneezes. 
       Measles travels through the air, so you can get measles 
       just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. 
       The virus can linger in enclosed spaces for up to two hours.</p>
    <ul>Measles outbreaks can occur when:
      <li>Travelers contract measles abroad and bring it back home</li>
      <li>The virus spreads through communities 
        with greater numbers of unvaccinated people</li>
    </ul>
